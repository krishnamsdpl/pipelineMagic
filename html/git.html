        <h1>Git Branching Strategy</h1>

        <h2>Master:</h2>
        <p>Represents the production-ready code. Only updated with code from release branches or hotfixes.</p>
      
        <h2>Develop:</h2>
        <p>Integration branch where ongoing development and feature work occurs. Feature branches are merged into this branch when features are complete.</p>
      
        <h2>Feature Branches:</h2>
        <p>Created off the develop branch for developing new features. Merged back into the develop branch when the feature is complete.</p>
      
        <h2>Release Branches:</h2>
        <p>Created from the develop branch when preparing for a new release. Used for final testing and bug fixing before merging into master. Merged into both master and develop when the release is ready.</p>
      
        <h2>Hotfix Branches:</h2>
        <p>Created from the master branch to quickly address critical issues in production. Merged into both master and develop to ensure fixes are included in future releases.</p>
      

        <h1>Reverting the Latest Commit:</h1>

        <h1> latest commit revert below command</h1>
        <p>git revert HEAD</p>
        <h1>Reverting a Specific Previous Commit:</h1>
        <p>git log <br>
         git revert commit-hash

        </p>

        <h1>What is Rebase</h1>
        <p>In Git, rebasing is a process that allows you to modify the commit history by moving, combining, or altering the order of commits. 
        The primary goal of rebasing is to create a linear commit history, making it easier to understand and navigate the project's development timeline</p>
        <h1>Understanding Git Merge, Rebase, and Squash</h1>

        <h2>1. Git Merge</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Merge</strong> is a Git command used to combine changes from one branch into another. It creates a new commit that has two parent commits,
            preserving the commit history of both branches. While it's straightforward, it can result in a more complex and "noisy" commit history.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
    git checkout main
    git merge feature-branch
            </code>
        </pre>
    
        <h2>2. Git Rebase</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Rebase</strong> is another integration strategy that involves rewriting commit history by applying the changes of one branch on top of another.
            It produces a linear and cleaner commit history, reducing "merge commits" and making the history easier to follow. However, rewriting history can be risky,
            especially if changes have been shared with others.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
    git checkout feature-branch
    git rebase main
    git checkout main
    git merge feature-branch
            </code>
        </pre>
    
        <h2>3. Git Squash</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Squash</strong> is used to combine multiple commits into a single commit before integrating changes into another branch. It collapses multiple
            commits into one, creating a cleaner and more concise commit history. However, it comes with the trade-off of losing the individual commit history,
            which may be important for detailed tracking.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
    git checkout main
    git merge --squash feature-branch
            </code>
        </pre>
    
        <p>
            It's important to choose the integration strategy that aligns with your project's workflow and collaboration practices.
            Communicate and agree with your team on the preferred strategy to maintain a clear and manageable commit history in your Git repository.
        </p>
