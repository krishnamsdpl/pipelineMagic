  <h1>1.What is Kubernetes?</h1>
  Answer: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
  <h1>2.Explain the key components of Kubernetes architecture.</h1>
  <p><strong>Key components include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Master Node:</strong> Manages and controls the cluster.</li>
  <li><strong>Node/Minion:</strong> Worker machines where containers are deployed.</li>
  <li><strong>Pod:</strong> Smallest deployable unit, containing one or more containers.</li>
  <li><strong>Service:</strong> Network abstraction to expose a set of pods.</li>
  <li><strong>ReplicaSet:</strong> Ensures a specified number of replicas for a pod are running.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Manages updates to applications.</li>
</ul>

<h1>3.What is a Deployment in Kubernetes?</h1>

<p>Answer: A Deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that provides declarative updates to applications. It allows you to describe an applicationâ€™s life cycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of pod replicas, and the way to update them.</p>

<h1>4.How can you scale a deployment in Kubernetes?</h1>

<p>Answer: Use the kubectl scale command or update the replicas field in the Deployment YAML file.</p>

<h1>5.What is a Pod in Kubernetes?</h1>

<p>Answer: A Pod is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model, representing a single instance of a running process in a cluster.</p>
<h1>6.How are Pods different from containers?</h1>

<p>Answer: A Pod can host multiple containers that share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost</p>
