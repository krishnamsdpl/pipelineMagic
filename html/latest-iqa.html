<h1>What is difference b/w build pipeline and release pipeline?</h1>  
<p>
<b>Build Pipeline:</b>

Purpose: The primary purpose of a build pipeline is to compile, build, and package the source code into executable artifacts or binaries.<br>
It involves activities such as compiling code, running unit tests, and creating deployable artifacts.

<b>Stages:</b> A typical build pipeline consists of stages like code compilation, unit testing, code analysis, and artifact packaging. 
It ensures that the codebase is in a deployable state and provides a basis for further testing and deployment.
<b>Triggers:</b> Build pipelines are often triggered by code changes or commits to a version control system (e.g., Git). When developers push changes, the build pipeline automatically starts to verify the code's integrity.

<b>Release Pipeline:</b>

<b>Purpose:</b> The release pipeline is concerned with deploying the built artifacts to different environments (e.g., development, testing, staging, production) in a controlled and automated manner. It involves activities like environment provisioning, deployment, and possibly post-deployment testing.
<b>Stages:</b> A release pipeline typically includes stages for deploying to different environments, with each stage having its own set of tasks such as deployment, configuration updates, and testing. It helps manage the progression of the software from one environment to another until it reaches production.
<b>Triggers:</b> Release pipelines are often triggered manually or automatically after a successful build. Manual approval gates may be included to ensure that the release is ready to move to the next stage.

<h1>What is Nginx server</h1>
<p class="big">
<h1>Web Server:</h1>
Nginx is often used as a standalone web server to serve static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Its event-driven architecture allows it to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

<h1>Reverse Proxy:</h1>
Nginx is commonly deployed as a reverse proxy in front of application servers (such as those running Node.js, Python, or Ruby applications). The reverse proxy forwards client requests to the backend servers and then returns the response to the clients. This helps in load balancing, caching, and enhancing security.

<h1>Load Balancer:</h1>
Nginx can distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to balance the load. This ensures that no single server becomes overwhelmed with too many requests, improving overall system performance, scalability, and reliability.

<h1>SSL/TLS Termination:</h1>
Nginx can handle SSL/TLS termination, decrypting encrypted HTTPS traffic and forwarding it as plain HTTP to backend servers. This offloads the SSL/TLS processing from the application servers, improving performance.

<h1>Caching:</h1>
Nginx can cache static content and responses from dynamic content to improve performance and reduce the load on backend servers. This is particularly useful for serving frequently requested content quickly.

<h1>Security Features:</h1>
Nginx includes various security features, such as access controls, rate limiting, and the ability to hide server details from HTTP headers, which can enhance the security of web applications.

<h1>HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Support:</h1>
Nginx supports modern HTTP protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, providing improved performance and reduced latency compared to older versions.

<h1>Extensibility:</h1>
Nginx supports a modular architecture, allowing users to extend its functionality through third-party modules. This flexibility enables customization based on specific use cases and requirements.
