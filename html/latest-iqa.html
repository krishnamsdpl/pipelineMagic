<h1>What is Nginx server</h1>
<p class="big">
<h1>Web Server:</h1>
Nginx is often used as a standalone web server to serve static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Its event-driven architecture allows it to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

<h1>Reverse Proxy:</h1>
Nginx is commonly deployed as a reverse proxy in front of application servers (such as those running Node.js, Python, or Ruby applications). The reverse proxy forwards client requests to the backend servers and then returns the response to the clients. This helps in load balancing, caching, and enhancing security.

<h1>Load Balancer:</h1>
Nginx can distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to balance the load. This ensures that no single server becomes overwhelmed with too many requests, improving overall system performance, scalability, and reliability.

<h1>SSL/TLS Termination:</h1>
Nginx can handle SSL/TLS termination, decrypting encrypted HTTPS traffic and forwarding it as plain HTTP to backend servers. This offloads the SSL/TLS processing from the application servers, improving performance.

<h1>Caching:</h1>
Nginx can cache static content and responses from dynamic content to improve performance and reduce the load on backend servers. This is particularly useful for serving frequently requested content quickly.

<h1>Security Features:</h1>
Nginx includes various security features, such as access controls, rate limiting, and the ability to hide server details from HTTP headers, which can enhance the security of web applications.

<h1>HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Support:</h1>
Nginx supports modern HTTP protocols like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, providing improved performance and reduced latency compared to older versions.

<h1>Extensibility:</h1>
Nginx supports a modular architecture, allowing users to extend its functionality through third-party modules. This flexibility enables customization based on specific use cases and requirements.
